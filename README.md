# Image Search Engine using Resnet18 and YOLOv10n

![image_search_engine_follow](./image_search_engine_flow.png)

This engine tackles the challenge of finding similar images within a dataset with impressive speed and accuracy. 

Here's what it offers:

**Blazing-Fast Search**: Locate visually similar images in a massive test set (41k images from COCO 2017) with an average search time of just 300ms.

**Deep Learning Powerhouse**: Leverages the power of ResNet-18 for generating image embeddings and YOLOv10n for tagging and indexing.

**Simplified Vector Search**: Similar to a vector database, it utilizes indexing and cosine similarity for efficient searching.

Think of it as a lightweight vector search engine built for image retrieval.

This project demonstrates the power of combining deep learning techniques for feature extraction and efficient indexing methods for fast search.
